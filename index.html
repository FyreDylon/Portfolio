    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a student studying video game design at Sno-Isle Tech Skills Center while attending Lake Stevens High School. I've designed and
        programmed multiple games using C# while attending Sno-Isle, ranging from console based RPGs to using virtual reality, one of which competed in a state competition.
        I'm a skillful, kind, and dependable individual who works well in a team setting. I pick up new skills quickly and executes tasks efficiently with
        precision. I've excelled in working with others and making sure everyone brings their best skills to the table.

        I really enjoy putting together stories and worlds for people to get lost in, both on paper and through screens.
        One of my life goals is to put together a story that millions of people around the world will appreciate.
        I want to be the writer that brings joy to other people, just like the writers before me.

        I’ve realized in my career as a video game developer that I feel much more comfortable designing than coding.
        It’s much easier for me to create environments and characters than using coding languages.
        Even though I have this preference, I don't back down when presented a coding challenge.
